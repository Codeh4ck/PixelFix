# Pixel Fix
Pixel Fix is an application that fixes stuck pixels by rapidly rotating the screen color.

# Disclaimer
Pixel Fix is an application that fixes stuck pixels by rapidly rotating the screen color. It has been proven that by rotating the screen
color rapidly, a stuck pixel can be "rebooted" and start working again. The project includes the following features:

* Can set how much time the rotator will run
* You can set the colors that will be rotated through
* If you want to stop earlier, hit the Escape (Esc) button
* Does not meddle with any windows. Everything happens in the program's form

# Health risk notice
**Do not use this program if you have a history of epilepsy or seizures in general. Strobing light and rapdily-rotating colors can provoke a seizure. If you ignore this warning, the author of this program is not to be held responsible. You agree to this term by running this program. You have been warned.**

# Testing
This tool has been tested on an 24" Samsung IPS monitor and appears to be working flawlessly. The monitor had 6 stuck pixels and all of them are working perfectly, after a 1 hour rotation with **Pixel Fix**. The only issue was that the room had to be locked in order to prevent anyone from potentially getting a seizure :P
